# QuickScope Enhancement Summary

## Date: December 14, 2024

### 1. Paste Transcript Functionality ✅

**Issue**: User needed ability to paste transcript text directly from Fathom instead of only uploading files.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added toggle between "Upload Files" and "Paste Transcript" modes in CallTranscriptsIntegration component
- New UI includes:
  - Transcript Title input field (required)
  - Large textarea for pasting transcript text
  - Word count display
  - AI processing button
- Automatically calculates estimated duration based on word count (150 words/minute average)
- After processing, automatically switches to library tab to show results

**User Benefits**:
- Quick copy/paste workflow from Fathom
- No need to save transcripts as files first
- Same AI analysis and insights as file uploads
- Seamless integration with existing features

### 2. Refresh Company Names Fix ✅

**Issue**: "Refresh Company Names" button wasn't updating companies with placeholder names like "Company 9130357468892206".

**Root Cause**: Tokens were expired, and the function was skipping them instead of refreshing.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added automatic token refresh logic to `/api/admin/refresh-company-names` endpoint
- When a token is expired:
  1. Attempts to refresh the token using QuickBooks OAuth
  2. Updates the database with new token
  3. Fetches company info with refreshed token
  4. Updates company name in database
- Added detailed logging for debugging

**User Benefits**:
- Company names will now update even with expired tokens
- Better error reporting if refresh fails
- Automatic token management

### Technical Details

**Files Modified**:
1. `app/components/CallTranscriptsIntegration.tsx`
   - Added inputMode state for toggle

The platform will automatically handle token refresh in the background when needed.
