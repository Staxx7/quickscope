  - financial_snapshots, audit_decks, sales_activities
  - industry_benchmarks, generated_reports

### Hour 2-3: Service Consolidation ‚úÖ
- **Created unified service factory** (`app/lib/serviceFactory.ts`)
- **Consolidated duplicate QuickBooks services** into single implementation
- **Updated all endpoints** to use unified services
- **Implemented automatic token refresh** for QuickBooks OAuth

### Hour 3-4: Dashboard Routing Fix ‚úÖ
- **Fixed dashboard authentication flow** to check database instead of localStorage
- **Updated OAuth callback** to redirect directly to dashboard

- **Created financial snapshots endpoint** for report data
- **Created generated reports endpoint** for storage
- **Added report templates** (Financial, Audit, Analysis, Comprehensive, Investor)

### Hour 6-7: Testing & Validation ‚úÖ
- **Created comprehensive integration test suite** (`scripts/test-integration.ts`)
- **Tests cover**: Environment, Database, APIs, QuickBooks, AI, External APIs
- **Automated test reporting** with pass/fail metrics
- **Recommendations engine** for missing configurations

### Hour 7-8: Production Readiness ‚úÖ
- **Created production preparation script** (`scripts/prepare-production.sh`)
