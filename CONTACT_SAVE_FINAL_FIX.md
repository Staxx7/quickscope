# Contact Save Issue - Final Fix Summary

## Problem Description
Users reported "Failed to save contact information" errors when trying to add contacts through the QuickScope platform.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Errors
- Browser showed CSP violations preventing JavaScript evaluation
- Error: `The Content Security Policy (CSP) prevents the evaluation of arbitrary strings as JavaScript`
- Added comprehensive CSP headers in `next.config.js` to allow necessary operations

### 2. Supabase Schema Cache Issue
- Primary error: `Could not find the 'annual_revenue' column of 'prospects' in the schema cache`
- Error code: `PGRST204`
- Despite the column existing in the database schema, Supabase's PostgREST API couldn't recognize it

### 3. Row Level Security (RLS) Issues
- Initial attempts to save contacts were blocked by RLS policies
- Previously fixed by using service role key for server-side operations

### 4. TypeScript Build Error
- ContactForm.tsx had type errors preventing deployment
- File was accidentally created and has been removed

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added CSP Headers (next.config.js)
```javascript
headers: [
  {
    key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
    value: [
      "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'",
      // ... other directives
    ].join('; ')
  }
]
```

### 2. Permanently Removed Financial Fields
Based on user feedback that manual input of financial data is unnecessary, permanently removed:
- `annual_revenue` field
- `employee_count` field

These fields were removed from:
- `/api/prospects/create-or-update/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `/app/admin/prospects/create/page.tsx` - Form UI
- `/api/admin/prospects/route.ts` - Admin API
- `/api/ai/generate-audit-deck/route.ts` - Audit deck generation
- All test files

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed logging throughout the save process
- Better error messages for users
- Diagnostic endpoints for troubleshooting

## Current Status
- Contact save now works with essential fields: name, email, phone, industry
- Financial data will be pulled directly from QuickBooks integration
- All build errors fixed and deployment successful

## Database Schema Note
While the `prospects` table in Supabase still has the `annual_revenue` and `employee_count` columns, they are no longer used by the application. Financial data is now exclusively sourced from QuickBooks integration for accuracy.

## Testing
Use the simplified test script:
```bash
node test-contact-save-simple.js
```

This creates a contact with only the essential fields that are actively used.
