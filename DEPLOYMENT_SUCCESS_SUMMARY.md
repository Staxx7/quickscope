## What You Can Do Now

   - Fill in the form and save
   - Watch the workflow stage update automatically

2. **Use Company Selector**
   - Look for the dropdown in the header
   - Select any connected company
   - Navigate between dashboard sections
   - Selected company persists

3. **Monitor Workflow Progression**
   - After adding contact: Stage changes to "Ready for Transcript"
   - After uploading transcript: Stage changes to "Ready for Analysis"
   - After running analysis: Stage changes to "Ready for Report"

## Regarding API Confidence
The BLS and Census APIs have valid keys but aren't returning data. This could be due to:
- Rate limiting
- API service issues
- Incorrect endpoint URLs
- Data format changes

The platform still functions well with FRED and Market Data APIs providing "medium" confidence level.

## Testing Commands
Run these to verify functionality:
```bash
# Test all APIs
./test-deployed-apis.sh

# Test specific industry
curl "https://www.quickscope.info/api/market-intelligence?industry=healthcare" | jq
```

## Next Steps for Full API Integration
1. Check Vercel logs for BLS/Census error details
2. Verify API endpoints are current
3. Test API keys directly with providers
4. Consider implementing fallback data sources
