# QuickScope UI Improvements
*Updated: ${new Date().toISOString()}*

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Polish Changes Implemented

### 1. âœ… **Fixed Dropdown Z-Index Issue**
**Problem**: Company selector dropdown was hiding behind other UI elements
**Solution**: 
- Increased z-index from `z-50` to `z-[100]` for dropdown menu
- Added backdrop with `z-[90]` that closes dropdown when clicked
- Dropdown now appears above all other content

### 2. âœ… **Enhanced Dropdown Styling**
**Improvements**:
- Added backdrop blur effect (`backdrop-blur-md`) for modern glassmorphic look
- Improved hover states with smoother transitions
- Added subtle borders between dropdown items
- Better spacing and padding for touch-friendly interaction
- Rounded corners on badges for consistent design
- Added escape key handler to close dropdown

### 3. âœ… **Replaced Redundant "Next Steps" Section**
**Problem**: Next steps were already visible in the main table, making bottom card redundant
**Solution**: 
- Replaced with "Workflow Progress Overview" showing company counts by stage
- Created 4 beautiful gradient cards showing:
  - Companies needing contact info (yellow theme)
  - Companies ready for transcript upload (orange theme)
  - Companies awaiting analysis (purple theme)
  - Companies ready for report generation (green theme)
- Each card shows count and descriptive text

### 4. âœ… **Improved Header Layout**
**Enhancements**:
- Better spacing between page title and company selector
- Company selector positioned with `ml-auto` for consistent right alignment
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to action buttons to prevent compression
- Mobile view improvements with proper spacing

## Visual Improvements
- **Glassmorphic effects**: Added `backdrop-blur-sm` to dropdown button
- **Smooth transitions**: All hover effects now use `transition-all duration-200`
- **Better contrast**: Semi-transparent backgrounds with proper opacity levels
- **Consistent borders**: Unified border colors and styles across components

## User Experience Enhancements
