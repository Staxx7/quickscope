# QuickScope Platform - Latest Fixes Summary
*Last Updated: ${new Date().toISOString()}*

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Contact Save Error Fixed
**Problem**: "Failed to save contact information" error when adding contact details
**Solution**: 
- Fixed the `qbo_tokens` update query to first fetch the token data, then update by ID
- Added better error handling with specific error messages
- Contact information now saves successfully

### 2. âœ… Global Company Selector Added
**Problem**: No way to select companies when navigating between dashboard sections
**Solution**: 
- Created `GlobalCompanySelector` component that persists across all pages
- Added to `AdminLayout` header (visible on desktop and mobile)
- Automatically syncs with URL parameters
- Shows workflow stage and connection status for each company

### 3. âœ… Workflow Stage Progression Implemented
**Problem**: Workflow stages were static and didn't update based on data availability
**Solution**: 
- Created `/api/prospects/update-workflow-stage` endpoint
- Workflow stages now progress automatically:
  - `needs_prospect_info` â†’ No contact info
  - `needs_transcript` â†’ Has contact, no transcript
  - `needs_analysis` â†’ Has transcript, no AI analysis  
  - `ready_for_report` â†’ Has everything
- Stage updates automatically when contact info is added

### 4. ðŸ”„ API Confidence Issue (In Progress)
**Problem**: Market intelligence showing "medium" confidence instead of "very high"
**Current Status**: 
- BLS API: Returns null (API key issue or service down)
- Census API: Returns null (API key issue or service down)
- FRED API: Working âœ“
- Market Data (Alpha Vantage/Finnhub): Working âœ“
- Added debug logging to track API failures

### 5. âœ… Build Error Fixed
**Problem**: Vercel build failing with "useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary" error
**Solution**: 
- Fixed all pages using `useSearchParams()` by adding proper Suspense boundaries
- Updated components:
  - `/admin/audit-deck/page.tsx`
  - `/admin/prospects/create/page.tsx`
  - `/success/page.tsx`
  - `/connect/page.tsx`
  - `/launch/page.tsx`
  - `GlobalCompanySelector.tsx`

## Deployment Status
- Initial Commit: `9221945` 
- Fix Commit: `7bab677`
- Pushed to GitHub for Vercel auto-deployment
- Site: https://www.quickscope.info

## Next Steps
1. **Monitor Vercel deployment** (usually takes 2-3 minutes)
2. **Test the fixes**:
   - Try adding contact information again
   - Check if company selector appears in header
   - Verify workflow stages update after adding contact
3. **Debug API issues**:
   - Check Vercel logs for API error messages
   - Verify API keys are correctly set in Vercel environment
   - Test `/api/test-apis` endpoint once deployed

## How to Use Company Selector
- The company dropdown now appears in the header of all dashboard pages
- Selecting a company updates the URL parameters
- All dashboard sections will use the selected company
- No need to navigate back to main dashboard to switch companies

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Build passes on Vercel
- [ ] Add contact information for a company
- [ ] Verify workflow stage changes from "needs_prospect_info" to "needs_transcript"
- [ ] Test company selector dropdown functionality
- [ ] Verify selected company persists across page navigation
- [ ] Check market intelligence API confidence level

## Technical Notes
- Next.js 13+ requires `useSearchParams()` to be wrapped in Suspense boundaries
- All components using `useSearchParams()` must be split into separate components with Suspense wrappers
- Added loading fallback components for better UX during Suspense
