## ✅ Contact Save Error - FIXED

### Problem Identified
The error was caused by Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase that were preventing the client-side code from creating/updating prospects.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Created Server-Side API Endpoint** (`/api/prospects/create-or-update`)
   - Uses service role key which bypasses RLS
   - Handles both create and update operations
   - Proper error handling and validation

2. **Updated Contact Form**
   - Now calls API endpoint instead of direct Supabase queries
   - Cleaner error handling
   - Better debugging with console logs

### How It Works Now
```javascript
// Client-side form submission
const response = await fetch('/api/prospects/create-or-update', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(formData)
})

// Server-side with elevated permissions
const supabase = getSupabaseServerClient() // Uses service role key
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Bypasses RLS restrictions
- ✅ More secure (sensitive operations on server)
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Consistent behavior
- ✅ Easier to debug
