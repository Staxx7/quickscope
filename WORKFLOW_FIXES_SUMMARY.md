# Workflow Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Extract Data button showing popup instead of navigating**
2. **Company context not maintained across workflow steps**
3. **Call transcripts not persisting when navigating away**
4. **Financial analysis showing test data instead of real company data**
5. **Workflow steps not prompting for next action**

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created WorkflowManager (`lib/workflowManager.ts`)
A comprehensive state management system that:
- Maintains workflow state across all steps for each company
- Persists data in localStorage (transcripts, financial data, etc.)
- Handles navigation with proper context preservation
- Tracks workflow progress and completed steps
- Provides consistent navigation methods to prevent popups

### 2. Updated CorrectedAccountWorkflowDashboard 
- Replaced direct navigation with WorkflowManager.navigateToStep()
- Added event.preventDefault() and stopPropagation() to prevent popups
- Starts workflow when clicking Extract Data
- Maintains company context through all navigation

### 3. Enhanced Data Extraction Page
- Added workflow progress bar showing current step
- Integrated GlobalCompanySelector for company switching
- Uses WorkflowManager to maintain state
- Prompts to continue to next step after extraction
- Shows selected company context prominently

### 4. Enhanced Call Transcripts Page
- Persists uploaded transcripts using WorkflowManager
- Shows previously uploaded transcripts when returning to page
- Displays transcript count and analysis results
- Prompts to continue to Financial Analysis after upload
- Maintains company context through workflow

### 5. Fixed Financial Analysis Page
- Updated to load real data based on companyId prop
- Removed automatic mock data generation
- Only shows demo data when no company is selected
- Fetches comprehensive analysis including financial data

## Workflow Flow

1. **Dashboard** → Click "Extract Data" for a company
   - Starts workflow with WorkflowManager
   - Navigates to data extraction with company context

2. **Data Extraction** → Extract financial data
   - Shows workflow progress (Step 2 of 6)
   - Saves extracted data to workflow state
   - Prompts to continue to call transcripts

3. **Call Transcripts** → Upload/paste transcripts
   - Shows workflow progress (Step 3 of 6)
   - Persists transcripts in localStorage
   - Shows previously uploaded transcripts
   - Prompts to continue to financial analysis

4. **Financial Analysis** → Analyze with real data
   - Uses real QuickBooks data + transcript insights
   - No longer shows test/demo data
   - Maintains full context from previous steps

5. **Report Generation** → Generate reports with context
   - Has access to all previous workflow data
   - Can generate contextual reports

6. **Audit Deck** → Final deliverable
   - Leverages all accumulated data and analysis

## Key Features

### Context Preservation
- Company ID and name passed through URL parameters
- Session storage backup for company selection
- WorkflowManager maintains all data between steps

### Data Persistence
- Transcripts saved in localStorage by company
- Financial data saved in workflow state
- Analysis results preserved across navigation

### Navigation Reliability
- Multiple navigation methods (router.push with window.location fallback)
- Event handling to prevent popup interceptors
- Direct URL construction with proper parameters

### User Experience
- Clear workflow progress indicators
- Prompts for next steps after each action
- Company context visible on every page
- Ability to switch companies while maintaining data

## Testing

Created `test-navigation-fix.js` to verify:
- Extract Data button navigates without popups
- Company context is maintained in URL
- Proper page loads with company data

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:
1. Test with real Stax LLC data
2. Verify transcript persistence across sessions
3. Ensure financial analysis uses live QuickBooks data
4. Test complete workflow from start to finish
5. Verify audit deck generation with full context
